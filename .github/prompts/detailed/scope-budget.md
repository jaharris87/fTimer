## Scope Budget

Start with the smallest review context that can answer the review question.

Default review starting point:

1. the PR diff
2. the touched files
3. the relevant tests changed by the PR

Expand beyond that only when necessary.

### Expand context only if the review question requires it

- Read `docs/semantics.md` only when the diff changes runtime behavior, public contract, or edge-case semantics.
- Read `README.md` only when the PR changes user-facing behavior, examples, installation guidance, or public documentation.
- Read `docs/design.md` only when the PR introduces new abstractions, architecture changes, or future-design alignment questions.
- Read workflow docs only when the review specifically concerns issue / PR / disposition process rather than code correctness.

### Anti-churn rules

- Do not perform a broad repo sweep by default.
- Do not reread unchanged files without a specific reason.
- Prefer fewer, more serious findings over speculative exploration.
- If additional context is needed, expand incrementally and state why.
